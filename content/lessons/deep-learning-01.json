        "content": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers — hence 'deep' — to learn from data.\n\n**The hierarchy:**\n- Artificial Intelligence (broadest)\n  - Machine Learning (learning from data)\n    - Deep Learning (using deep neural networks)\n\n**Key differences from traditional ML:**\n\n**Traditional ML:**\n- Requires hand-crafted features\n- You tell it what to look for\n- Works well with smaller datasets\n- Examples: decision trees, support vector machines\n\n**Deep Learning:**\n- Learns features automatically from raw data\n- Discovers what matters on its own\n- Needs large datasets to shine\n- Examples: convolutional neural networks, transformers\n\nThink of it this way: In traditional ML, you tell the model 'look for edges, corners, and textures' in an image. In deep learning, you just show it millions of images and it figures out what features matter."

        "content": "Artificial neural networks are inspired by biological neurons in the brain. Here's how an artificial neuron works:\n\n**Structure of a neuron:**\n\n1. **Inputs**: Receives multiple input values\n   - Like dendrites receiving signals in biological neurons\n\n2. **Weights**: Each input has a weight (importance)\n   - Some inputs matter more than others\n   - These weights are learned during training\n\n3. **Sum**: Multiply each input by its weight and add them up\n   - Weighted sum = (input₁ × weight₁) + (input₂ × weight₂) + ...\n\n4. **Activation function**: Applies a non-linear transformation\n   - Decides if the neuron should 'fire'\n   - Common functions: ReLU, sigmoid, tanh\n\n5. **Output**: Sends the result to the next layer\n   - Like axons transmitting signals in biological neurons\n\n**Simple example:**\nPredicting if someone will buy a product:\n- Input₁: time_on_page (5 minutes) × weight₁ (0.3) = 1.5\n- Input₂: previous_purchases (10) × weight₂ (0.5) = 5.0\n- Input₃: price_viewed (2) × weight₃ (0.2) = 0.4\n- Sum = 6.9\n- Apply activation function → Output: high probability of purchase\n\nThe magic is in learning the right weights."

        "title": "How Neural Networks Learn",
        "content": "Training a neural network involves adjusting weights so predictions improve:\n\n**The process (forward and backward):**\n\n**1. Forward Pass:**\n- Input data flows through the network\n- Each layer transforms the data\n- Final layer produces a prediction\n\n**2. Calculate Loss:**\n- Compare prediction to actual answer\n- Compute error (how wrong we were)\n- Example: predicted '7' but actual was '3' → high loss\n\n**3. Backward Pass (Backpropagation):**\n- Calculate how much each weight contributed to the error\n- Work backward through layers\n- This is the 'learning' step\n\n**4. Update Weights:**\n- Adjust weights to reduce the error\n- Use an optimizer (like gradient descent)\n- Weights that caused errors get adjusted most\n\n**5. Repeat:**\n- Process thousands or millions of examples\n- Weights gradually improve\n- Network learns to make better predictions\n\nThink of it like practicing basketball free throws:\n- Take a shot (forward pass)\n- See if it went in (calculate loss)\n- Analyze what went wrong (backpropagation)\n- Adjust your technique (update weights)\n- Try again (repeat)\n\nOver time, the network gets better at its task."

    "summary": "Deep learning uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn from data. Each neuron receives inputs, multiplies them by learned weights, and applies an activation function to produce an output. Networks are organized in layers — input, hidden, and output — with information flowing forward and learning happening through backpropagation. Deep learning differs from traditional ML by automatically learning features from raw data rather than requiring hand-crafted features. The convergence of big data, powerful GPUs, and algorithmic improvements has made deep learning the dominant approach for complex tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.",

      "question": "What's the main difference between traditional machine learning and deep learning?",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "options": [
        "A: Deep learning is always more accurate",
        "B: Deep learning automatically learns features from raw data, while traditional ML requires hand-crafted features",
        "C: Traditional ML can't use neural networks",
        "D: Deep learning doesn't require data"
      ],
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "The key difference is feature learning. Traditional ML requires humans to engineer features (edges, textures, patterns), then the algorithm learns from those. Deep learning learns features automatically from raw data — you can feed it raw pixels and it discovers what features matter. This makes deep learning powerful but data-hungry."

      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "options": [
        "A: A piece of data",

      ],
      "correct": "B",
      "explanation": "Each connection has a weight — a number learned during training that determines how important that connection is. When information flows through the network, it's multiplied by these weights. Training adjusts the weights to improve predictions. A neural network with thousands of neurons might have millions of weights to learn."
