        "title": "Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Learning",
        "content": "These terms describe how many examples you provide in your prompt:\n\n**Zero-Shot Prompting** means giving no examples — just instructions:\n'Translate this to French: Hello, how are you?'\n\nThe AI uses its training to complete the task without seeing examples. This works well for common tasks.\n\n**Few-Shot Prompting** means providing examples before your actual request:\n'Translate to French:\nEnglish: Good morning → French: Bonjour\nEnglish: Thank you → French: Merci\nEnglish: Hello, how are you? → French:'\n\nFew-shot is more powerful because:\n- It shows the AI exactly what format you want\n- It demonstrates the style or approach\n- It reduces ambiguity\n- It works better for unusual tasks\n\nRule of thumb: Start zero-shot for speed. Add examples (few-shot) if results aren't meeting your needs."

        "title": "Chain-of-Thought Prompting",
        "content": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting asks the AI to show its reasoning step-by-step. This dramatically improves performance on complex tasks.\n\n**Without CoT:**\n'Is 47 a prime number?'\nAnswer might be wrong.\n\n**With CoT:**\n'Is 47 a prime number? Let's think step by step.'\n\nThe phrase 'Let's think step by step' or 'Show your reasoning' triggers the AI to break down the problem:\n'To check if 47 is prime:\n1. Check if it's divisible by 2: 47 is odd, so no\n2. Check if divisible by 3: 4+7=11, not divisible by 3\n3. Check up to √47 ≈ 6.9\n4. Not divisible by 2, 3, 5\nTherefore, 47 is prime.'\n\nCoT is especially valuable for:\n- Math and logic problems\n- Multi-step reasoning\n- Debugging code\n- Complex analysis\n\nJust adding 'explain your reasoning' can significantly improve accuracy."

        "title": "Role-Playing and Persona Prompts",
        "content": "Assigning the AI a specific role or persona shapes its responses powerfully:\n\n**Generic Prompt:**\n'Explain quantum computing'\nProduces generic, unfocused content.\n\n**With Persona:**\n'You are a physics professor known for making complex topics accessible. Explain quantum computing to a smart 12-year-old using everyday analogies.'\n\nEffective personas include:\n- **Expert roles**: 'You are a senior software architect with 15 years of experience'\n- **Communication styles**: 'You are a patient teacher who uses simple language'\n- **Specific perspectives**: 'You are a skeptical journalist fact-checking a claim'\n- **Character traits**: 'You are enthusiastic and encouraging'\n\nThe persona creates a mental framework for the AI. It's like hiring the right expert for the job.\n\nYou can even combine roles: 'You are both a scientist and a storyteller, making research accessible through narrative.'"

Do not exceed 200 words. Do not use bullet points.'\n\nTrack what works. Keep a collection of your best prompts for reuse and adaptation."

    "summary": "Effective prompting techniques significantly improve AI outputs. Zero-shot prompting provides no examples while few-shot includes examples to guide the AI. Chain-of-thought prompting asks the AI to show its reasoning step-by-step, improving accuracy on complex tasks. Role-playing and persona prompts shape the AI's perspective and expertise. Using structured patterns like RTF and CRISPE makes prompting systematic. Finally, iterative refinement through progressive specificity and incremental constraints helps you optimize your prompts over time.",
