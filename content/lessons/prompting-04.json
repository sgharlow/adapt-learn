Set the Creative Temperature:** Use medium to high temperature (0.7-0.9) for variety\n\n**2. Provide Constraints:** Length, tone, style, themes\n\n**3. Specify Style References:**\n'Write in the style of Hemingway: short sentences, minimal adjectives, strong verbs'\n\n**4. Use Emotional Direction:**\n'The story should evoke wonder and curiosity, building to a moment of realization'\n\n**5. Iterate on Variations:**\n'Generate 3 different opening paragraphs, each with a different mood'\n\nFor poetry, specify form:\n'Write a sonnet about artificial intelligence, following the Shakespearean sonnet structure with iambic pentameter'\n\nCreative prompts work best when they provide direction without over-constraining the AI's imaginative capacity."

Request Testing:**\n'Include 5 test cases covering edge cases: empty string, missing @, multiple @, valid email, international characters'\n\n**3. Ask for Comments:**\n'Add inline comments explaining the regex pattern'\n\n**4. Define Error Handling:**\n'Use try-except blocks and raise ValueError with descriptive messages'\n\n**5. Use Low Temperature:** Set to 0.1-0.3 for deterministic, correct code\n\n**6. Request Explanations:**\n'After the code, explain how the regex pattern works line by line'\n\nFor debugging:\n'Here's code that's producing an error: [code]\nError message: [error]\nExplain the bug and provide the corrected code with explanation.'"

Demand Evidence:**\n'Support each claim with specific evidence. Quote directly when possible.'\n\n**2. Use Chain-of-Thought:**\n'Work through this problem step-by-step, showing all reasoning'\n\n**3. Request Multiple Perspectives:**\n'Analyze this decision from three perspectives: financial, ethical, and environmental'\n\n**4. Challenge Assumptions:**\n'Identify and question any assumptions in this argument: [argument]'\n\n**5. Compare and Contrast:**\n'Compare approaches A and B across these dimensions: cost, complexity, scalability, maintenance. Present in a table.'\n\n**For Data Analysis:**\n'Given this dataset: [data]\nPerform exploratory analysis:\n- Calculate key statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)\n- Identify trends and patterns\n- Flag anomalies or outliers\n- Suggest visualizations that would reveal insights'\n\nAlways ask for reasoning transparency in analytical tasks."

    "summary": "Different tasks require tailored prompting strategies. Creative writing prompts balance freedom with structure, using higher temperature and emotional direction. Code generation demands precision with low temperature, clear requirements, and test cases. Analysis and reasoning prompts need structured frameworks, evidence requirements, and chain-of-thought reasoning. Summarization prompts specify length and format, while extraction prompts define exact fields and structure. Classification, translation, moderation, and question-answering each have specific patterns. Building task-specific templates and testing them across diverse inputs creates reliable, reusable prompts.",
