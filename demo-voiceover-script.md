## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Must Say (for hackathon judges):
- **"ElevenLabs"** — 2-3 times (lesson audio + AI tutor audio)
- **"Google Gemini"** — 1-2 times (AI tutor intelligence)
- **"Voice-first"** or **"like a podcast"** — core differentiator
- **"Adaptive"** or **"knowledge gaps"** — the smart feature
- **URL** — adapt-learn-rosy.vercel.app

### Exact UI Labels:
- Path card: "AI Explorer" (whole card clickable)
- First lesson: "What is Machine Learning?"
