💡 THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING
Traditional AI learning is text-heavy and screen-bound. Busy professionals can't dedicate hours to video lectures. AdaptLearn brings AI education to your commute, workout, or kitchen — anywhere you can listen to a podcast.

🎧 WHY VOICE-FIRST?
• Learn during activities where screens aren't practical
• Audio engages different cognitive pathways
• Podcast-style learning fits modern lifestyles
• Natural voices (ElevenLabs) are more engaging than robotic TTS
