## Recording Checklist

### Before Recording

- [ ] Close all unnecessary apps
- [ ] Clear browser tabs
- [ ] Disable notifications (system + browser)
- [ ] Test microphone levels
- [ ] Run `/demo-preload` to cache audio
- [ ] Set demo data: `/?demo=progress` or start fresh
- [ ] Test full demo flow once
- [ ] Have script visible (second monitor or printed)
- [ ] Glass of water nearby
- [ ] Good lighting if using webcam

### During Recording

- [ ] Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- [ ] Pause at key moments for emphasis
- [ ] Keep cursor movements smooth and deliberate
- [ ] Let audio play for full effect in Scene 4 & 5
- [ ] Don't rush - better to trim later

### After Recording

- [ ] Review footage immediately
- [ ] Note timestamps of best takes
- [ ] Check audio levels throughout
- [ ] Verify all key features were shown

---

## Multiple Takes Strategy

Record each scene 2-3 times. Best approach:

1. **First Take:** Warm-up, find rhythm
2. **Second Take:** Primary footage
3. **Third Take:** Safety, try variations

Keep recording even if you make a mistake - you can edit later.

---

## Voiceover Tips

- **Pace:** Slightly slower than natural conversation
- **Tone:** Enthusiastic but professional
- **Energy:** Higher than normal (translates well on video)
- **Pauses:** Brief pauses between sections
- **Emphasis:** Stress key words (ElevenLabs, adaptive, voice-first)

### Key Phrases to Emphasize

- "Voice-first adaptive learning"
- "Powered by ElevenLabs"
- "Natural, engaging voice"
- "AI-powered recommendations"
- "Learn while you commute"

---

## Video Editing Notes

### Basic Structure

```
[Title Card - 3s]
AdaptLearn: Voice-First Adaptive AI Learning
"Learn AI like you listen to podcasts"

[Main Demo - 3-4 min]
Scenes 1-8 as recorded

[Closing Card - 3s]
ElevenLabs + Google Gemini
github.com/sgharlow/adapt-learn
```

### Suggested Transitions

- Simple cuts between scenes (don't over-produce)
- Subtle fade for intro/outro
- Zoom in on important UI elements (post-production)

### Audio Considerations

- Balance voiceover with app audio
- App audio should be audible but not overwhelming
- Consider adding subtle background music (royalty-free)

---

## Backup Plans

### If Voice Input Fails

Type the question instead. Say: "You can also type questions for a quick response."

### If Audio Generation is Slow

Use pre-cached audio. All demo lessons should be cached from `/demo-preload`.

### If You Make a Mistake

Keep recording! You can edit it out later. A continuous recording is better than multiple short clips.

### If API Errors

Show the graceful error handling. Say: "The system handles errors gracefully."
